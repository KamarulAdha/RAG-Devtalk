The economic expansion was similarly (international & domestic) Growing TNB’s non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB’s future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns. Customer 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB’s brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause customerdissatisfaction and impact our sales, EBIT and reputation. CREATING VALUE THROUGH STRONG GOVERNANCE Sec 4 187 Review, Monitor and Report The BRC/BSRC approved the TNB 3-Year Cycle Risk Governance Plan for implementation from FY2022 to FY2024. This plan is implemented by the RMD to assist the BRC/BSRC in meeting its terms of reference. The plan outlines three (3) risk governance activities, which are risk review, risk maturity assessment and desktop risk assessment. According to plan, RMD in collaboration with TNB business entities, conducted 15 risk reviews, five (5) risk maturity assessments and eight (8) desktop risk assessments in the year under review. As per the TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB business entities are responsible to assess respective risks and register into the TNB Risk Information System (TRIS), a centralised online real-time tool and database, for monitoring and reporting. Risks are also reviewed annually by the business entities with participation and eventual approval from the risk owners. Half-year risk reports are submitted by business entities to RMD for consolidation. Group-wide consolidated half-year risk reports, which include reports of emerging risks, are deliberated and critical enabler to future-proof our business as we continue implementing our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy Transition plan. In addition, we will continue to strongly support initiatives that will elevate the energy literacy of our citizens as they too are important stakeholders. A better understanding of energy systems and the various impacts of energy transition will enable decision makers to make more informed decisions, which will hopefully lead to a brighter future for our planet. Partnerships for Success FROM OUR LEADERSHIP Sec 2 31 Among the notable initiatives undertaken by TNB this year included the enhancement of the roles and renaming of the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC) in August 2023, which will assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilitiesby providing oversight of the implementation effectiveness of the Group’s sustainability and risk management frameworks. We also formed a new Sustainability Division, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer, with the key roles to ensure the effective deployment of our sustainability strategies, thus helping us to meet our targets and strengthening sustainability governance across the Group. OUTLOOK Looking ahead for Malaysia, economic growth is expected to track upwards to 4-5% in 2024, from the 3.7% recorded in 2023, driven by the recovery in exports and resilient domestic expenditure, according to Bank Negara Malaysia. Growth will be supported by a solid labour market, enhanced household spending and improvements in tourist arrivals. In addition, sustained investment activities propelled by ongoing multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, as well as the execution of catalytic initiatives under national master plans provides further upside. Fuel prices are also expected to ease in 2024. We see further upside for TNB going forward especially with the government’s robust efforts to drive the decarbonisation agenda.

Unfavourable Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) regulatory implementation and outcome Globally, the electricity supply industry is highly regulated. Government regulations and policies control various aspects, including approving generation capacity and mix, setting limits for investment and operation costs of electricity networks, and determining electricity prices. Uncertainty surrounding future regulations may hinder long-term planning and investment decisions whilst non-compliance with regulations can result in penalties and reputational damage. Inability to shape and manage the outcome of these regulation and policies governing the Malaysian ESI would be key impediment impacting TNB ability to deliver its business aspiration. 5. Regulatory Uncertainty Due to the nature of our business, we are susceptible to the decisions by regulatory stakeholders at the federal,state and international levels. Business operations may be delayed or encumbered due to measures and decisions in relation to investment and divestment, use of natural resources and right-of-way. Market 6. Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international & domestic) Growing TNB’s non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB’s future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns. Customer 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB’s brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause strategies, particularly its proactive communication ahead of seasonal events such as heatwaves and floods, and utilisation of a humanistic and empathetic tone that resonated well with the public. Digitalisation continues to play a pivotal role in the Retail Division’s strategy to enhance customer service. The adoption of the myTNB digital platform saw a notable increase of almost 10%, with subscribers reaching 6.68 million, up from 6.2 million in the previous fiscal year. Besides offering seamless payment options and the ability to manage energy consumption, the myTNB app also offers paperless billing which The diagram below summarises where our subsidiaries’ play in TNB’s ET value chain: has seen encouraging response as over 1 million subscribers have opted for digital billing. The app has been recognised for its value in empoweringcustomers and received the Best Public Utility App Award from PC.com in June 2023. myTNBiz is the digital platform for our business customers that was launched in October 2022 to provide service offerings such as bill viewing and bulk online payment. Specifically for our commercial and industrial customers, this platform is continuously gaining increased traction, with over 10,325 total users and 194,254 connected customer accounts. The year also saw exceptional growth in followership in TNB’s social media platforms experience, registering a 15% increase and achieving a reach of over 205.2 million across all social media platforms. The success in our digital engagement is indicative of the division’s ability to connect with our customers, offering solutions and energy efficiency tips that for the first time, ranked among the top 10 posts of the year. Lastly, TNB’s very own Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) was officially launched as a national-level initiative in March 2023. It aims to enhance energy literacy among Malaysians by educating the public on the significance of energy management and conservation. T o further embed energy literacy into the younger generation, TNB, CSI performance, comparable to that of top UK and US utilities. The CSI was first introduced 27 years ago, and TNB has diligently monitored it, using it as a crucial barometer of our overall performance and effectiveness of our service. This milestone achievement reflects a significant evolution in TNB’s approach to customer satisfaction, driven by a strategic shift in 2020 towards a customer-led paradigm that places customer needs and expectations at the forefront of its operations. Central to our customer-centric transformation is the way we measure the customer experience by using the Customer Experience Index, a comprehensive measure of customer interactions across various channels. The Retail Division achieved outstanding scores across the board, with Kedai Tenaga, TNB’s physical storefronts, leading at a 97% satisfaction score. This was closely followedby an impressive 96% for both the Careline service and the myTNB app, and a commendable 91% for the myTNB portal. In addition, we recorded good customer sentiment in social media presence, highlighting the positive and neutral feedback from customers. This high sentiment rating is largely attributed to TNB’s proactive engagement strategies, particularly its proactive communication ahead of seasonal events such as heatwaves and floods, and utilisation of a humanistic and empathetic tone that resonated well with the public. Digitalisation continues to play a pivotal role in the Retail Division’s strategy to enhance customer service. The adoption of the myTNB digital platform saw a notable increase of almost 10%, with subscribers reaching 6.68 million, up from 6.2 million in the previous fiscal year.

The international platforms will contribute significantly to TNB’s Net Zero aspiration by facilitating knowledge exchange, advancing expertise in renewable technologies, enabling technology uptake, and promoting international collaboration to accelerate the country’s sustainable energy transition. INTERNATIONAL GENERATION BUSINESS UPDATE On the international front, TNB International Sdn. Bhd. (TNBI), our platform for capturing global RE opportunities registered a higher full year performance from its onshore wind portfolio of around 100MWp in the United Kingdom (UK), which was acquired in 2022. In addition, overall power price was also favourable in 2023 in the UK region. However, this was offset by a non-cash impairment ofgoodwill for our investment in Vantage Solar UK Ltd. and Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Ltd. The impairment is an adjustment to reflect the softer power prices in the future and interest rate hike in the region, with no discount to the power plant performance. TNB’s Net Zero goal advances through international RE platforms, enhancing collaboration and technology in sustainable energy. FROM OUR LEADERSHIP Sec 2 41 ACHIEVING OUR STRATEGIC AMBITIONS Recognising the pivotal role of electricity transmission and distribution networks, TNB has consistently invested in crafting the Develop Energy Transition Network. This grid is designed to accommodate the growing incorporation of large-scale and distributed renewable energy (RE) sources, thereby playing a crucial role in Malaysia’s transition towards a more sustainable energy landscape.

       "'Diberi data TNB are resolute in supporting the growth of the nation by creating further value for all our stakeholders by leveraging new opportunities and realise the nation’s sustainability ambitions for a better and brighter future. The increase in electricity demand directly contributed to TNB’s top-line growth of 4.3% YOY in 2023, with revenue growing to RM53.07 billion. However, we recorded lower EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) of RM18.6 billion and RM2.6 billion respectively, mainly due to the negative fuel margin. Our liquidity and cashflow position have improved significantly in 2023 as we recorded a 56% reduction in receivables, mainly through consistent cost recovery of Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) as well as efforts made by TNB to improve our collection rate. Operational excellence remains a cornerstone of our strategy, andwe strive to ensure our infrastructure assets remain robust and available to serve our customers. We recorded a Transmission System Minutes of 0.48 minutes, while our Distribution System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) was 46.1 - which puts us on par with other global utilities. Our power plants recorded a solid 83.3% availability factor throughout 2023, a testament to the efforts of our employees in upholding world-class standards of operational excellence in the operation and maintenance of our electricity supply infrastructure. With regards to the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors, our Loss Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) was 0.74, a slight improvement from the 0.82 recorded in 2022. In 2023, we recorded the unfortunate loss of four lives - three employees and one contractor. We understand the gravity of the situation and are taking all the necessary preventive measures to ensure the safety of everyone with the enforcement of Tenaga Safety Culture and Life Saving Rules. PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS Malaysia’s economy continue its growth trajectory in 2023 at a moderated pace of 3.7% compared to the robust 8.7% in 2022. The economic expansion was similarly (international & domestic) Growing TNB’s non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB’s future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns. Customer 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB’s brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause customerdissatisfaction and impact our sales, EBIT and reputation. CREATING VALUE THROUGH STRONG GOVERNANCE Sec 4 187 Review, Monitor and Report The BRC/BSRC approved the TNB 3-Year Cycle Risk Governance Plan for implementation from FY2022 to FY2024. This plan is implemented by the RMD to assist the BRC/BSRC in meeting its terms of reference. The plan outlines three (3) risk governance activities, which are risk review, risk maturity assessment and desktop risk assessment. According to plan, RMD in collaboration with TNB business entities, conducted 15 risk reviews, five (5) risk maturity assessments and eight (8) desktop risk assessments in the year under review. As per the TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB business entities are responsible to assess respective risks and register into the TNB Risk Information System (TRIS), a centralised online real-time tool and database, for monitoring and reporting. Risks are also reviewed annually by the business entities with participation and eventual approval from the risk owners. Half-year risk reports are submitted by business entities to RMD for consolidation. Group-wide consolidated half-year risk reports, which include reports of emerging risks, are deliberated and critical enabler to future-proof our business as we continue implementing our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy Transition plan. In addition, we will continue to strongly support initiatives that will elevate the energy literacy of our citizens as they too are important stakeholders. A better understanding of energy systems and the various impacts of energy transition will enable decision makers to make more informed decisions, which will hopefully lead to a brighter future for our planet. Partnerships for Success FROM OUR LEADERSHIP Sec 2 31 Among the notable initiatives undertaken by TNB this year included the enhancement of the roles and renaming of the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC) in August 2023, which will assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilitiesby providing oversight of the implementation effectiveness of the Group’s sustainability and risk management frameworks. We also formed a new Sustainability Division, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer, with the key roles to ensure the effective deployment of our sustainability strategies, thus helping us to meet our targets and strengthening sustainability governance across the Group. OUTLOOK Looking ahead for Malaysia, economic growth is expected to track upwards to 4-5% in 2024, from the 3.7% recorded in 2023, driven by the recovery in exports and resilient domestic expenditure, according to Bank Negara Malaysia. Growth will be supported by a solid labour market, enhanced household spending and improvements in tourist arrivals. In addition, sustained investment activities propelled by ongoing multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, as well as the execution of catalytic initiatives under national master plans provides further upside. Fuel prices are also expected to ease in 2024. We see further upside for TNB going forward especially with the government’s robust efforts to drive the decarbonisation agenda.

Since 2019, we have adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework that serves as a comprehensive approach for assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, ensuring a thorough evaluation of the associated financial implications. TCFD CORE ELEMENTS IN TNB We govern climate-related matters by integrating them into the TNB corporate governance system, with oversight from the Board and management We adopt the TNB Risk Management Framework,with continuous constant effort to address both transition and physical risks, and opportunities in the short-, medium- and long- term strategic risks across TNB business entities We prioritise to ensureensuring business resiliency and continuous efforts in addressing climate change scenarios and exposures through our Reimagining TNB strategy and TNB Energy Transition Plan We identify and set climate-related quantitative targets and monitor related metrics to ensure the realisation of the Net Zero by 2050 aspiration Risk Management Strategy Governance STRATEGY Our priority is to ensure that our business is resilient in addressing climate exposures in our business strategy with continuous assessment to adapt to transition and physical risks and opportunities in the short-, medium- and long-term. Scenario Description Expected global temperature increase by 2100 Risk exposure to TNB Business Physical Transition IPCC’s RCP 8.5/4°C (high emission scenario) The ‘Business as usual’ scenario suggests a likely outcome if society does not make concerted efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. >4°C High High IPCC’s RCP aspirations for a Better, Brighter Future. From inception, marked by the nation’s electrification, to present-day leadership in green energy solutions, TNB remains steadfast in the commitment to driving sustainable progress. As we embark on the next phase of our journey, we stand poised to continue leading the charge towards a more resilient and sustainable energy landscape. As TNB marks its 75th anniversary on 1st September 2024, it signifies a significant milestone in the shared history, intricately woven into the fabric of Malaysia’s growth and progress.

Unfavourable Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) regulatory implementation and outcome Globally, the electricity supply industry is highly regulated. Government regulations and policies control various aspects, including approving generation capacity and mix, setting limits for investment and operation costs of electricity networks, and determining electricity prices. Uncertainty surrounding future regulations may hinder long-term planning and investment decisions whilst non-compliance with regulations can result in penalties and reputational damage. Inability to shape and manage the outcome of these regulation and policies governing the Malaysian ESI would be key impediment impacting TNB ability to deliver its business aspiration. 5. Regulatory Uncertainty Due to the nature of our business, we are susceptible to the decisions by regulatory stakeholders at the federal,state and international levels. Business operations may be delayed or encumbered due to measures and decisions in relation to investment and divestment, use of natural resources and right-of-way. Market 6. Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international & domestic) Growing TNB’s non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB’s future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns. Customer 7. Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB’s brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause strategies, particularly its proactive communication ahead of seasonal events such as heatwaves and floods, and utilisation of a humanistic and empathetic tone that resonated well with the public. Digitalisation continues to play a pivotal role in the Retail Division’s strategy to enhance customer service. The adoption of the myTNB digital platform saw a notable increase of almost 10%, with subscribers reaching 6.68 million, up from 6.2 million in the previous fiscal year. Besides offering seamless payment options and the ability to manage energy consumption, the myTNB app also offers paperless billing which The diagram below summarises where our subsidiaries’ play in TNB’s ET value chain: has seen encouraging response as over 1 million subscribers have opted for digital billing. The app has been recognised for its value in empoweringcustomers and received the Best Public Utility App Award from PC.com in June 2023. myTNBiz is the digital platform for our business customers that was launched in October 2022 to provide service offerings such as bill viewing and bulk online payment. Specifically for our commercial and industrial customers, this platform is continuously gaining increased traction, with over 10,325 total users and 194,254 connected customer accounts. The year also saw exceptional growth in followership in TNB’s social media platforms experience, registering a 15% increase and achieving a reach of over 205.2 million across all social media platforms. The success in our digital engagement is indicative of the division’s ability to connect with our customers, offering solutions and energy efficiency tips that for the first time, ranked among the top 10 posts of the year. Lastly, TNB’s very own Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) was officially launched as a national-level initiative in March 2023. It aims to enhance energy literacy among Malaysians by educating the public on the significance of energy management and conservation. T o further embed energy literacy into the younger generation, TNB, CSI performance, comparable to that of top UK and US utilities. The CSI was first introduced 27 years ago, and TNB has diligently monitored it, using it as a crucial barometer of our overall performance and effectiveness of our service. This milestone achievement reflects a significant evolution in TNB’s approach to customer satisfaction, driven by a strategic shift in 2020 towards a customer-led paradigm that places customer needs and expectations at the forefront of its operations. Central to our customer-centric transformation is the way we measure the customer experience by using the Customer Experience Index, a comprehensive measure of customer interactions across various channels. The Retail Division achieved outstanding scores across the board, with Kedai Tenaga, TNB’s physical storefronts, leading at a 97% satisfaction score. This was closely followedby an impressive 96% for both the Careline service and the myTNB app, and a commendable 91% for the myTNB portal. In addition, we recorded good customer sentiment in social media presence, highlighting the positive and neutral feedback from customers. This high sentiment rating is largely attributed to TNB’s proactive engagement strategies, particularly its proactive communication ahead of seasonal events such as heatwaves and floods, and utilisation of a humanistic and empathetic tone that resonated well with the public. Digitalisation continues to play a pivotal role in the Retail Division’s strategy to enhance customer service.
